cp .secret.example .secret.local
```

firebase functions:secrets:set SECRET_NAME
```

[reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env#create-secret)

---

## Develop

```bash
pnpm serve
```

---

## Deploy

Using [deploy.sh](./deploy.sh) script to handle deploy flow, because `firebase function` doesn't not support monorepo

---

## Database Connection

### Two different database urls

1. `DATABASE_URL` should include `pgbouncer=true` to handle connection pooling during booking tickets
2. `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL` should be url without pgbouncer for update large data (ex:train information)

### Using pgBouncer for serverless functions

Using pgBouncer for serverless functions to avoid `connection timeout`
